This project seeks to build a generic Makefile setup that works on all major
platforms with no modifications. It supports C/C++ projects using the Gnu C/C++
tools, and supports simple graphics projects using OpenGL, and freeglut. 

The system has many features designed ot make building and testing projects
easy. This system is being used by my students at Austin COmmunity COllege.

Type ``make help`` to see what build commands are available.
